Coursera Lesson 2: Mapping Data to Python

In this lab I created a new Jupiter Notebook named NewJupyterNotebook.ipynb. In this notebook I imported the "wine-ratings-small.csv" file and then filtered this file by wine variety. After filtering I then saved my results to a new file named eduardoNewJson.json.
